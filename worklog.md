- Status mix: 6 issued, 11 available, 1 maintenance
- Condition mix: 8 new, 9 good, 1 fair

### Verification
- `bun run db:push` - Database already in sync
- `bun run seed` - All 18 IT assets and 6 issuances created successfully
- `bun run lint` - No errors

## Task 3: IT Asset Management View

### What was done:
1. **Updated API routes** to include full issuances with user details:
   - `GET /api/it-assets` - Added `issuances` include with `issuedTo` and `issuedBy` user relations
   - `PUT /api/it-assets/[id]` - Added same issuances include for consistent responses

2. **Built comprehensive `ITAssetsView` component** (`src/components/erp/it-assets-view.tsx`) with:
   - **6 KPI cards**: Total Assets, Available, Issued, In Maintenance, Total Value, Warranty Expiring (within 30 days)
   - **Category filter tabs**: All, Laptop, Desktop, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Headphone, USB/Storage, Other
   - **Two main sub-tabs**: "Asset Inventory" and "Issuance Records"
   - **Asset Inventory tab**:
     - Search bar (by name, asset tag, serial number, brand, model)
     - Status filter buttons: All, Available, Issued, Maintenance, Retired
     - Grid/List view toggle with animated transitions
     - Asset Cards with category icons, color-coded bars, status badges, condition dots, assigned user avatars, warranty warnings, and quick action buttons
     - Asset Rows for list view with compact inline display
   - **Asset Detail Sheet** (right panel):
     - Full asset info with category icon, status badge, condition dots
     - Specifications display (parsed from JSON)
     - Purchase information (date, cost, vendor, invoice)
     - Warranty status with expiry countdown bar
     - Current assignment with user details
     - Issuance history displayed as a timeline
     - Action buttons: Issue, Return, Mark Maintenance, Retire
   - **Issue Asset Dialog**: Select user, purpose, expected return date, issue condition, notes

   - Proper empty states for both tabs
   - Smooth framer-motion animations with staggered reveals
   - Responsive design (mobile-first with grid breakpoints)

3. **Lint passed** with zero errors after fixing react-hooks/static-components rule (using `React.createElement` for dynamic icons instead of JSX component variables)

### Files modified:
- `src/app/api/it-assets/route.ts` - Added issuances include
- `src/app/api/it-assets/[id]/route.ts` - Added issuances include
- `src/components/erp/it-assets-view.tsx` - Complete rewrite from placeholder to full component

### Key design decisions:
- Used emerald/teal as primary colors throughout (no blue/indigo)
- Category colors follow spec: laptop=emerald, desktop=slate, monitor=cyan, keyboard=violet, mouse=amber, headphone=rose, usb=teal, other=gray
- Dynamic icons rendered via `React.createElement` to satisfy lint rules
- Warranty indicators show days left with color-coded warnings
- Overdue issuances highlighted with rose background in table
- Asset tags auto-suggested based on category prefix (IT-LAP-XXX, IT-DST-XXX, etc.)
